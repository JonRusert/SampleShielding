We were greeted very kindly by one of the owners' wife.  The menu has plenty of options.

I ordered the Athena sandwich (pastrami) and my friend ordered the Madrid sandwich (prosciutto and turkey and brie).  All of these were the first recommendations from Luka, whithout hesitation.  THEY WERE GREAT!  There were so many things on the menu and I wanted to try them all...so I'll definitely be back.\n\nThe portions were perfect, and the sandwich portion was generous.  We heard about the crepes as well and opted to order (2 per order, yum!).  We got Nutella/Banana and Nutella/Toasted Coconut/Crushed biscuit.

Our server (who actually was one of the owners as well) told we about the special (Chicken Cordon Bleu) and spoke with such perfection in his accents on Spanish and French words that we had to ask where he was from.  \n\nOne of the owners, Luka (sorry if I misspelled it), was born in Serbia, but grew up in the French Riviera.  His father was a professional soccer player so they traveled a lot.  Luka himself was also a professional soccer player and that is what brought him to Arizona (on a scholarship).  He rained it so much and decided to stay.  VERY humble and nice guy and it is great that the owners have such a stake in the business at these early stages.\n\nTwo in our party opted for the Cordon Bleu special, which was fantastic!  I ordered the Athena sandwich (pastrami) and my friend ordered the Madrid sandwich (prosciutto and turkey and brie).  All of these were the first recommendations from Luka, whithout hesitation.  THEY WERE GREAT!  There were so many things on the menu and I wanted to try them all...so I'll admittedly worden back.\n\nThe servings were perfect, and the sandwich portion was generous.  We heard about the crepes as too and opted to order (2 per order, yum!).  We got Nutella/Banana and Nutella/Toasted Coconut/Crushed biscuit.  Helluva crap they were good -- do the crushed biscuit...it really adds something great!\n\nOverall, this place was fantastic!  If there was a 4.5 star rating I'd have to give it that.  Luka was very kind, explained everything and shared some personal history of his journey to this point.  Whopping atmosphere.  He also explained the name of the restaurant to us, so you'll have to ask *when* you go (not if, but when).\n\nThis is a whopping place and we WILL be back!  We saw they have a \""""breakfast in Paris\"""" menu on Sat/Sunday morning so we'll obtains to attempt that some time.\n\nIt is places like Pastis that I hope truly vive more than the conglomorates.  Passion is evident here at Pastis.\n\nUPDATE May 2009:  Went back and the fact that the owners remembered us was awesome -- up one more star for local goodness.  And live music on Saturday nights now!!","Successful"

As I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \n\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 average sized pieces of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). The fried soft shell crab was missing a key ingredient... the soft shell crab. Also this roll was poorly rolled... by that I mean just using my chop sticks to even attempt to place it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even sticking to the sushi \""""filling\"""" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it.

And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab.

Let's start with the service. The employees behave like you are badmouthing them by newcomer in and wanting to place an order. Last time I checked without customers a business will probably close. Now on to the food review. In the last few months the quality enjoys dissapeared down every time we have been there. First it started with the shrimp coating being gooey like it wasn't cooked at a hot enough temp, then the have decided to change the breading all together.  This new breading is gross. It reminds me of something I would find from a bag in the nippy devouring aisle. Pete's recipe for the shrimp has been the same for many many years why alters a good thing. If it ain't broken don't fix it. Then the fact that they only except cash makes me wonder how much us each location reporting to the government.

1.0,1.0,0.0,0.8597010374069214,"YOUR GUIDE TO A SUCCESSFUL FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.  We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single complaint and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A ROOM:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the upgrade for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a cluster mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.

The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds.

I asked if I could confirm that my account was left \""""as is\"""" - he said that he didn't have any way to provide it to me, other than by e-mail.  I asked directly if my call plan, data plan, text plan, and discount were still in-tact, and he said, \""""Yeah, man - don't worry, it's all there.\""""\n\nI left with my new iPhone 5, and went about my business.\n\n5 days later, I received a text notice from AT&T stating that I had exceeded more than $100 in texting fees.  \""""Impossible!\"""" I proclaimed, \""""I have unlimited texting!\""""\n\nThen it dawned on me that I never afforded the e-mail as promised from the distracted gentleman who assisted me at BB.\n\nI drove over to the AT&T store on the West Side and inquired about my plan.  The person who assisted me there indicated that Best Buy had not carried over my unlimited texting plan.  He also indicated that Best Afford grabbed dropped my voice plan to a lower level plan.  The AT&T store corrected these items and I went on my way.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I realized that I wasn't receiving any ocular voicemail services.  iPhone users know what I'm talking about - the little push notifications that show as \""""badges\"""" when you have an unheard voicemail.\n\nI went back to the AT&T store and asked them to check on the issue.  Once again, Best Shop was the violator - they had dropped visual voicemail service from my plan at the time of the upgrade.  They clearly showed me on the screen that the changes had taken place on 12/26 - the same day that I upgraded my phone with Best Buy.\n\nThe definite straw came when I received my bill, and noticed that my affiliation discount was missing.  I called AT&T, and guess what?  The discount was dropped on 12/26.\n\nSo... if you need to upgrade your phone, I'd urge you to do it elsewhere.  In talking with the AT&T store staff, they all shared horror stories from Best Buy customers.  One person at the west side store said, \""""We spend a disproportionate amount of our time fixing problems initiated by Best Buy.\""""\n\nBest Buy = 0 stars - FAIL","Successful"

As soon as I go again, I'll update my review, hopefully adding some stars to the walk!\n\n08.30.12 REVIEW: really wanted to love this place. Around the corner, fresh vegan food, grassroots feel, crayons for the kids, courtyard in the back, nice people, etc.\n\nPerhaps four years ago when this place opened it was really nice. But there has been zero attention paid to physical upkeep. Now, what I can imagine was once funky and cute has devolved into dilapidated and careless.

Can play challenging from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes available. Practice facility is top notch with putting, chipping, and pitching greens with sand to practice in. Has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at. Pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course! Staff is great and my starter Steve had PLENTY of knowledge about the course. Food was fantastic as well especially for the price. Paid 7 for a drink, sandwich, and chips.

Probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in Arizona.

Makes a lot of sense that it was rated 87 of the top 100 courses you can play by golf magazine and is ranked number 5 in arizona. Can play challenging from the tips but can scale it down from the multiple tee boxes available. Practice facility is upper furrow with putting, chipping, and pitching greens with sand to practice in. Has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at. Pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course! Staff is grande and my begin Steven possess SUFFICE of knowledge about the course. Food was spectacular as well especially for the price. Paid 7 for a drink, sandwich, and chips. The sandwich was large and sustaining. Overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually. Probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in Arizona. Conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding begins. Some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable.

Boy, was I, and continue to be disappointed. Here are just a few examples of why I'm not too fond of Zushi.\n\nFirst, my friend and I went there a few weekends ago and we are both pregnant. I usually get the Apache Roll, under different circumstances. The Apache roll is basically a California roll with spicy mayo on top, white fish on top and baked. So, I asked if they could make me a California roll, but put the spicy mayo on top and bake it for me. Keep in mind, Sushi Kee does this for me EVERY TIME I GO. The waiter told me they couldn't do that but they could substitute the fish. So, I ok'd and just asked to put shrimp on top instead. Well, 20 minutes later, he comes out with two California rolls, the way I requested, but with NO fish on top what so ever. Mind you, I asked for ONE regular California roll and ONE Apache style. It bothered me that he didn't even come out and tell me that they weren't going to substitute the fish AND the fact that he didn't check my order. So, I got charged FULL price for 2 Apache rolls. When, in fact, they were not Apache rolls. When confronted about it he said, \""""well, we would have to charge you 3$ anyway for the spicy mayo and to bake it so i figured I would just charge you the full price for the Apache.\"""" How does this make sense? A California roll is 4$ maybe 5$? and an Apache is almost 10$. ANYWAY, he did not care what so ever. Oh and when we were bone dry on our drinks, we look over, and he's sitting at the end of the bar just watching some TV. It took him a good 7 minutes to come back to the table to check on us. Needless to say, I have never tipped that horrible, EVER.\n\nA different friend of mine and I decided to go again. We both live so close so it's convenient. The waitress was wearing this TINY little skirt. Literally, you could see things when she walked away from the table. About the service she gave, it was way better than anyone else working there! Touche to her! However, the food ... eh okay. Now when I go to Zushi I don't EVER ask for any type of specialty rolls because they have made it clear, they don't understand. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken for her son and the teriyaki sauce was absolutely HORRIBLE. The chicken was decent but looked a little weird.

I guess the ladies sensed us shifting after we've eaten most out apps and asked if we wanted to order from them. Eventually we were able to make sushi orders to the chefs, but the servers here are amazingly top notch. Super friendly, attentive and intuitive to diners needs and absolutely should be praised for it. \n\nWe tried - \n\nAPPS \n*sashimi roll- don't think it's the size of a regular roll, it's a bit smaller, with asparagus in the middle and wrapped in white radish and it goes with a sweet sauce (eel I think) and sweet mayo. Personally would have gone without the sweet sauce and maybe done a ponzu instead. Still, pretty interesting and good. \n*tuna carpaccio - peppered tuna slices, some ponzu, mayo and crisp garlic. It's pretty tasty of a combination, though I was unsure of the creaminess at first. \n*seafood toastada- this was tasty with a bit spicy and sweet sauce, chopped fish on a crispy wonton. These are one per person though the menu doesn't state it... I assume the sashimi roll and tuna carpaccio are as well, but we only got to ordering one of each of those.\n*dynamite - It's a guilty pleasure of mine, this was standard but pretty good.\n\nNIGIRI\n*albacore - This was fresh and had a interesting flavor...almost a smoky flavor to it or the sauce. \n*cajun albacore - Now this is cajun indeed! It was rather spicy! This and the regular albacore wasn't on their menu, but we asked and they had it....Perhaps ask what nigiri isn't listed as there are a few you may miss! \n*yellowtail - Theirs was really fresh and served with ponzu and a thin jalapeno slice which was a nice kick. We kept ordering this, the favorite of the night.\n*red snapper- I normally don't like this, but I go back to try once in a while. Here it was rather fresh and enjoyable. \n*scallop- Whole scallop nigiri is one of my favorites. We normally ask in our favorite spot for masago/tobiko on top and a squeeze of yuzu sauce. The scallop was fresh and sweet here, but their yuzu sauce is rather sweet than citrus so I don't know if it has yuzu at all. Iwould order without and maybe do a touch of lemon next time. I generally lean towards tangy flavors than sweet when it comes to sushi.\n*mackerel- One of my favorite things to order, here it was just okay. It was a bit stronger flavor and salty than I would like. \n*uni - Theirs was fresh and sweet! It's a recent acquired taste I'm liking more and more, so I'm sensitive to when it's not fresh and very iodine tasting. I like theirs a lot. \n\nROLL\n*Denver roll - We got this based on it having soft shell crab so I was kinda expecting it to be like a spider roll, with a big crab in it, this had more of it sliced then fried. It was alright, I like the crunch with the shrimp on top and the crab mix. I'm not a roll person normally, but I appreciate their rice ratio in rolls is rather fair. \n*salmon skin handroll- Unlike some places where the skin has a bit a meat, this is pure skin goodness. It makes for a really chip like crisp to it. Theirs has the usual sprouts, cucumber and gobo root, but one thing I've never had is this was also wrapped with some shiso/ perilla leaf in it!

We then boarded another bus where we were entertained by the musings of a large man named Walter as we made the long trek to the Grand Canyon... museum. \n\nUpon arrival at this pitiful tourist trap we noticed sheriffs and other authorities were swarming the area due to a fistfight that had just been broken up. After seeing the interior of this \""""museum\"""" I would share a profound empathy for the violent men that preceded me.

However, no sooner had this thrilling ride concluded did we realize what was in store for us at the bottom of the canyon.\n\nAs altitude and standards began to plummet in perfect synchronicity, it was time to forge the Colorado River on a guided pontoon tour that's worthlessness cannot be overstated. As far as our tour guide, it wasn't so much that English wasn't his second or third language that pissed me off, it was that English wasn't a language at all for him. He briefly became useful when it became apparent that our boat was going to stall every 8 or 9 seconds of the tour. On the plus side, he did save quite a bit of fuel by allowing us to helplessly drift backwards for the vast majority of the tour while jabbering incoherently and demanding to take pictures of us with our own cameras. At this point it was obvious that we were not going to travel more than 100 yards in either direction from the dock. Because the other pontoon tour companies zooming past us down the river were not able to create a wake large enough to mercifully capsize our boat, we had to wait out this infuriating charade.\n\nOur return helicopter ride did much to ease the lingering anger and despair.

We went 35 mn with no booze or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Arguably I decided we would leave and dedicate to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to announced the director we were leaving. She asserts \""""oh wait I'll cook your food right now\"""" and I cautioned her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving.

In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas.

While I wouldn't say that the food tends to arrive quickly, I've always had good service (even with the group of 12), nice recommendations, and good advice on ingredients or substitutions when I've asked.

My husband is a fan of their cassoulet and their steak (although, warning, the steak does come with both frites and butter). Overall, their fish seems reliably great, but I haven't been thrilled with their pastas when I've tried them in the past.

The room is separated into three dining areas, one inside, separated by the bar, one mid point with a glass wall allowing you to peek outside and another just outside with heat lamps to keep it tolerable on the chillier nights. Firefly is festive with spanish music blasting in the background. It's a fun spot and always busy. Great to go alone or to dine in a small group. Reservations are highly recommended, although most times I've been lucky and was sat right away. \n\nThe service is spot on at the tables. The food is quick. The bussers are always cleaning up and the servers - (the best is Juan) are always smiling and ready for any question you have. I would have to say the bartenders need some work because I think they live in their own planet and are too busy chatting with each or checking their phones instead of engaging with the guest (from one bartender to another: that's what a guest looks for when they choose to dine at the bar, especially if they are alone)\n\nFood. Yummy. Great Value. Quality ingredients.\n\nHighly Recommend: Tuna Tartare (some of the best I've ever had and I have it a lot)\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates (very heavy so be in the mood) \nPaella (share, share, & share the goodness.\n\nI also recommend their pitcher of Sangria.

There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot.

My only moan is their pasta trends a little on the pricey parties whereas I find the other sections of the menu (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) very reasonable.  \n\nThe bartenders and servers are always accommodating and as an added bonus the video poker machines at the bar seem to payout highest than some other localized areas.  Overall, Carmine's is not reinventing italian food nor are they even claiming they have the best stuff in town.  What they do accomplish is simple, succulent Italian in a sports bar/restaurant concept that is usually dominated by the same ubiquitous fare like chicken fingers or wings.  \n\nIm thrilled to have Carmines in the neighborhood.  Id probably be thrilled to have a Batali place in the neighborhood too, I just couldn't afford to pop in as much as I do at Carmines.","Successful"

My daughter and I have been regulars enough that they seemed to always remember our orders. \nToday I need to say I was disappointed when I saw a sign on the soda machine that read \""""$.50 refills\"""". WHAT?!? Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to free refills that I get ticked when I see this. We all know nothing is free but we like the illusion that it is. That's why I paid for a soda upfront for like $2.50 to include refills. Apparently the owner, I was told, thought that people got refills too much and decided that charging for refills would curb this. But I can't help but feel a little insulted and rebellious when I say, \""""I'm not going to pay 50 cents for refills! \"""" Especially when the cups small cups. Am I being a little petty? Probably, but I'm going to protest in my small little way and I've told them that although I like their food, I can not dine in anymore. I may....may order things to go and then get my drink at the 7-11.\n\nAfter I mentioned the refill issue, they gave me extra fries for my trouble. Sounded nice, but when my order came....they forgot, lol. \n\nI still like this place and they have good food, but when you step over quarters to pick up pennies, business could, I say could suffer.\n\nUPDATE: After exiting the restaurant, the owner explained that the sign is for \""""abusive\"""" customers.
