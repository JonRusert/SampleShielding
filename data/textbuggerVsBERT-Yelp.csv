It's a little hard to spot at first.\n\nInside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio.  It's so cute I could just squeeze it.  Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should.\n\nBut let's get to the good gimmick: the food.  I'm a big fan of morning grub and Tayl or's certainly offers.  My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced.  More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of del—ñcious.  If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count.\n\nI did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit.  Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.","Successful"

0.0,980.0,0.0,0.0016284584999084473,"Before I start my review, I must warn the reader that the one star rating is purely relative. The rating is not because the food was too expensive. Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).\n\nOriginally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution. \n\nI came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25). \n\nThe tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice. \n\nFirst, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.\n\nFurthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth. This foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt with a bit of crunch After a couple of chews, the foie gras did ultimately melt. That said, I just could not muster up the courage to tell our table side chef to his face that he had royally messed up the foie gras. One of the weaknesses that teppan yaki opens itself up to is a potential for inconsistency. The lobster tail and the wagyu beef, however, were immaculate, and could not be cooked better. The wagyu beef, cooked medium rare, literally melts after one bite. \n\nAs for the Jamon Iberico fried rice, I can certainly say that I was disappointed. Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured and is sliced thin and wide. Jamon Iberico should also melt in your mouth because of its marbling. When put on a grill and chopped up, the Jamon turns a bit chewy. The grilled Jamon is still of superior quality when compared to regular ham and I get that the whole point of grilling the Jamon is to extract the fat in order to make the fried rice just that much more savory and delicious. However, the end result is a bit lacking and I am not sure if the added taste to the dish makes up for the compromised texture of the Jamon.\n\nAs I was eating the fried rice, I decided to order a traditional Japanese garnish, takuan, to accompany my dish. It took a while for it to be served (~10 mins) and when served the takuan was of surprisingly poor quality. At a good Japanese restaurant you expect to be served takuan that is either off white or dark yellow in color. This takuan was bright yellow and cut way too thick. The most troubling thing about this is that takuan is used in sushi. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that touts its high quality food to serve such poor quality takuan. I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol. Otherwise, forget it.",1.0,0.5138016939163208,"Before I start my review, li should warn the reader that the eden stars rating is purely relative. The rating is not because the food was too expensive. Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).\n\nOriginally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution. \n\nI came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25). \n\nThe tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice. \n\nFirst, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.\n\nFurthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth.

Security took over 20 minutes to come to our room, discouraged us from making a report, was rude and demea’∏ing, and not ready with the particulars to fi‚Öºe a report. Managemenùöù would not speaùíå to us personal‚Öºy, and disreg…ërded our claim, say that it \""""was out of their fingers\"""" then it was passed to security. after the return of our visited, we took the fololwing actions- \n(l) li called the Drector of Secure yetserday, and lfet a message. 7:45 am\n(2) I decided to wait it out for the 1st business day of the week, and follow up today 8:00 am...\nWe were told to follow up with Risk management. \n(3) I was then passed me onto, Bill Parker- Director of Claims. I spoke with a woman named, Amanda 8:10 am who then told me that this was not handled in their department, and asked me to call Guest Relations. \n(4) I then spoke with the coordinator of Guest Relations, Janet 8:12 am. She is now telling me that her department usually deals with \""""guest satisfaction\"""", but graciously agreed to be my point of contact at the current moment.\n\nSo in conclusion, I was supposed to hear back from this woman by that Thursday, to give her a chance to gather the information, in which I never did. She did inform me however, that normally her department deals with \""""situation of quality of room, etc.\"""" We did not hear back from the hotel, or ever receive copies of the reports filed. We did not receive a follow up, no comps, not even an apology! Talk about the run around!!! It may not have relevance anymore, but it affected our safety, sanity, and most of all finances!!!

Glancing over the menu, which featured an average of twenty-something dollar items, we decided to share five or six dishes between us. My first negative remark: an establishment that features such remarkable ambiance and rather pricey menu items should not have paper wrapped wooden chopsticks, I laughed, thinking to myself that Koi had spent so much money on the d\u00e9cor they fell a few dollars short when it came to the utensils. Koi also allows patrons to enter this high end establishment in shorts in flip-flops, which I feel drastically diminishes the appearance of the place. It also became evident after waiting twenty minutes for any kind of service whatsoever, that this establishment was extremely under staffed. The drink menu was that of any standard high end Japanese restaurant so I decided to be a rebel and order an Asahi from their extensive beer menu; they possessed almost all of the Thai/Japanese beers I knew! Unfortunately, the waitress was so busy she ran by our table, dropped my boyfriend and my beer on the table with a chilled glass without a word and scurried off to assist another table. I'm not trying to be a snob, but shouldn't she have at least assisted in pouring my beer for me?! At my local watering hole sushi spot they always pour my beer for me, oh well. After another twenty something minute wait we finally gave our order, let me walk you through the items I chose to indulge!\n\n     Miso Soup, $5: I like the quality of the Miso Soup better at my local sushi spot in San Francisco. I felt like Koi's version was seriously lacking salt, and somewhat bland. \n     Edamame, $6: Awesome! Freshly steamed and hot with just the right amount of salt! I feel like Edamame can get soggy rather quickly but to my pleasant surprise, no soggy factor!\n     Tuna Tartare, $15: This was by far my favorite dish of the evening. In hindsight, I would have ordered five of this dish and called it a day! One order includes two silver dollar sized portions, rather small for how scrumptious this dish was. They serve the tuna with avocado on top of a deliciously crispy wonton, fabulous!\n     Yellow Tail Carpaccio, $20: Not impressed with this dish at all! I love yellow tail/Hamachi, but the quality of this fish was not fresh by any means. Again, I prefer the quality of fish at my local spot (maybe I should write a review for my local spot...) The yellow tail was thinly cut (like any carpaccio should be), dressed in Grapeseed oil, Ponzu, and Wasabi-Tobiko, which seemed rather oily and lacking any wasabi kick which I was craving.\n     Kope Beef Potstickers $23: These had an excellent flavor, although it seemed like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for a while due to the lacking wait staff. Served with a Ponzu dipping sause, I gobbled these down quickly. I'm convinced if these were served immediately after preparation had been completed I would have had absolutely no complaints whatsoever.\n     Baked Crab Roll, $12: Great roll, nice and creamy crab with a pleasant crunch on the exterior. Included wasabi and un-dyed ginger which was refreshing.\n     Veggi Tempura, $18: I loved the selection of vegetables they included in this dish; Asparagus, Green Beans, Yams, Onions, Shitakes, Eggplant and Carrots. Nice and crispy yet not over battered like tempura can be at times. I would have preferred a traditional dipping sauce however, the side sauce Koi paired with the dish was rather greasy, causing me after a few bites to simply shove it aside.\n\n     After completion of our meal, my boyfriend and I mutually decided to dine elsewhere for desert. I was not pleased with the service I received here, nor the quality of food in which was served. I would rather dine at Tao (located within the Venetian) or Nobu (Hard Rock) where I receive fabulous service that actually suits the high priced menu items. The atmosphere was by far the highlight of this venue; it is after all an extremely romantic setting, but that's where the glamour ends.

About 3 months ago I started going with a few friends instead of my dad, and I noticed each time I went without my dad, the time I was sitting there waiting got longer and longer.

I have been to several other buffets on the strip and the MGM has been my favorite because of the value.  Our waiter was a little slow to clear our plates and refill our drinks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.

It's the question that haunts all of us and never seems to escape our nightmares.  Well one of the answers for me is the MM buffet.  j have heard the Bellagio, Aladdin, and Rio are the better, but you will be salaries more there.  j have been to many other buffets on the strip and the GM has been my favored because of the value.  Our waiter was a scant slow to cle…ër our plats and refill our dr—ñnks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.  They have some of everything, which I guess would be awaited at any decent buffet, but these blokes seem to have it all.  B–µst chile relleno I've ever had in my life, really good cr\u00e8me brulee, and many types of cheesecakes among an incredible dessert selection.  For breakfast they do made-to-order omelettes, and at night cooked-to-order steak.  For dinner they Alaskan King Crab Legs, and the list could go on forever of course, but I sure did feel like I was at Disneyland when I noticed the stack of Cracker Jacks!

The dining area is beautiful and nicely decorated.  Booths are large and roomy.  So far, so good.\n\nWaitress introduced herself, and promptly brought us our drinks.

You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.\n\nFood:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poisoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Both of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. Its was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers. \n\nStaff: This is the absolute most horrible part about our experience. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We first sat at a table and after no one saying a word to us for 5 minutes, we decided to move to the bar in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything.  I answered \""""yes we have not been helped yet, we're ready to order\"""". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says \""""ok one second\"""". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with  mo-hawk like hair who's busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while \""""managing\"""") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her \""""no thank you, we've actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you.\"""" Her only answer to that statement was \""""OK\"""" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me \""""Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it\"""". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \""""John\"""" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job.

You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.\n\nFood:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poi—ïoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Boùöùh of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. It—ï was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers. \percent\nStaff: This is the absoluùöùe most horrible p…ërt about our enjoying. I seriously sizable reckon that the holders has so may uneperienced personnel that all are executing aroun‘Å fond chicke’∏s with their head—ï c’Ωt off. Ourselves fiirst sat at a ta–¨le and after no one saying a word to ours for 5 mintues, we d–µcided to move to the ba‚≤Ö in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything.  I answered \""""yes we have not been helped yet, we're ready to order\"""". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says \""""ok one second\"""". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with  mo-hawk like hair who's busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while \""""managing\"""") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her \""""no thank you, we've actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you.\"""" Her only answer to that statement was \""""OK\"""" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me \""""Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it\"""". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \""""John\"""" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues.

They will NOT come back to see if you need anything, so, like checking your bag before driving away from a McDonald's drive-thru, I suggest grabbing your server by the apron when they bring your meal, and holding on tight while you inspect everything, because that's the last you'll see of them at your table. Fail at that task, and be prepared to head over to the bar for anything you need from that point on. On top of that, they don't know how to prioritize, and will leave you standing at the door for ten minutes when you arrive, even if there are empty tables galore, because they're too frazzled or apathetic to get you seated with your menus before they take care of something else. I'd say they were understaffed if they had any jump in their step while ignoring you.\n\nSo here's the verdict: If you have two hours to kill on a sunny morning, and want to go someplace with a wonderful menu where you can sit outside, drink a nonrefillable beverage, and tip very low (I'd say 4%-6% is warranted if they don't screw up your order) then this may very well be the best place in the Plateau for you! If, however, you value service, like to be attended to more than three times (order, food and bill) and have your simple, quaint needs like \""""Puis-j'avoir une fourchette, s'il vous plait?\"""" addressed respectfully or promptly, your expectations are too high for Le Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9.\n\nI know there is no horror story here, because nothing really bad has ever happened, and the bistro is otherwise beautiful, flavourful and wonderfully located. No, instead the unique phenomenon is a complete lack of service, an absence, an abyss, a black hole, the Anti-Service.\n\nSo the entire experience at this neighbouorhood nook is nowhere near \""""plus-que-parfait\"""" and when word gets out about their lack of attention to their customers, they won't be \""""pr\u00e9sent\"""" on the culinary scene for long.

On top of that, they don't know how to prioritize, and will leave you standing at the door for ten minutes when you arrive, even if there are empty tables galore, because they're too frazzled or apathetic to get you seated with your menus before they take care of something else. I'd say they were understaffed if they had any jump in their step while ignoring you.\n\nSo here's the verdict: If you have two hours to kill on a sunny morning, and want to go someplace with a wonderful menu where you can sit outside, drink a nonrefillable beverage, and tip very low (I'd say 4%-6% is warranted if they don't screw up your order) then this may very well be the best place in the Plateau for you! If, however, you value service, like to be attended to more than three times (order, food and bill) and have your simple, quaint needs like \""""Puis-j'avoir une fourchette, s'il vous plait?\"""" addressed respectfully or promptly, your expectations are too high for Le Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9.\n\nI know there is no horror story here, because nothing really bad has ever happened, and the bistro is otherwise beautiful, flavourful and wonderfully located. No, instead the unique phenomenon is a complete lack of service, an absence, an abyss, a black hole, the Anti-Service.\n\nSo the entire experience at this neighbouorhood nook is nowhere near \""""plus-que-parfait\"""" and when word gets out about their lack of attention to their customers, they won't be \""""pr\u00e9sent\"""" on the culinary scene for long. That's the \""""futur simple\"""" in store if things don't shape up at Le Pass","Successful"

So ya it's going to be a pretty expensive snack! \n2.) FUKU BURGER - my all time faves have always been the tamago burger, the spicy burger, Naga dog and the togarashi fries. Please note that they cook their burgers medium so If u don't like seeing pink in your burgers u can specify how you want the meat cooked. I am sad to say though that although the food was still good the quality of food I had that day was below par. I had asked for my spicy burger to be medium well, it came out well done, also the fries were a bit on the overcooked side. On top of the food coming out about 20 mins. Later they had shorted us an order of the Katsu burger which he had forgotten to dispute since we were so hungry already and the kids were driving us nuts. So that was $10 for nothing.

So when u eat it u have to eat it in one big bite and u get a mouth full of the wonton wrapper. Gyozas- wrapper also very thick and the ground pork filling was falling apart as well.
