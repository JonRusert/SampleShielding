Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.\n\nMy most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.\n\nI also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.\n\nThere's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!\n\nBaggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.  Be prepared to get off your flight and go directly to get your bags, otherwise your gonna be late getting them!

Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had frankly promising experimented picking them up as properly.\n\nMy most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.\n\nI also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security domains.  Makes waiting for a flight much slowly, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.\n\nThere's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!\n\nBaggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.

Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).\n\nOriginally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution. \n\nI came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25). \n\nThe tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice. \n\nFirst, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.\n\nFurthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth. This foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt with a bit of crunch After a couple of chews, the foie gras did ultimately melt. That said, I just could not muster up the courage to tell our table side chef to his face that he had royally messed up the foie gras. One of the weaknesses that teppan yaki opens itself up to is a potential for inconsistency. The lobster tail and the wagyu beef, however, were immaculate, and could not be cooked better. The wagyu beef, cooked medium rare, literally melts after one bite. \n\nAs for the Jamon Iberico fried rice, I can certainly say that I was disappointed. Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured and is sliced thin and wide. Jamon Iberico should also melt in your mouth because of its marbling. When put on a grill and chopped up, the Jamon turns a bit chewy. The grilled Jamon is still of superior quality when compared to regular ham and I get that the whole point of grilling the Jamon is to extract the fat in order to make the fried rice just that much more savory and delicious. However, the end result is a bit lacking and I am not sure if the added taste to the dish makes up for the compromised texture of the Jamon.\n\nAs I was eating the fried rice, I decided to order a traditional Japanese garnish, takuan, to accompany my dish. It took a while for it to be served (~10 mins) and when served the takuan was of surprisingly poor quality. At a good Japanese restaurant you expect to be served takuan that is either off white or dark yellow in color. This takuan was bright yellow and cut way too thick. The most troubling thing about this is that takuan is used in sushi. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that touts its high quality food to serve such poor quality takuan. I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol.

I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol. Otherwise, forget it.","Successful"

The NZ bartender was quite friendly, and we chatted about the New Jersey Nets and Texas steak for a bit.  \n\nThe menu is quite diverse, with traditional Scottish fare, specialty burgers, salads (yes, salads!), and a full range of desserts.  I only wanted something small and ordered a lamb stew special that was very good - and very spicy.  It certainly hit the spot on a cold December evening!\n\nI emphatically recommended this situ, although I may or may not return based on the monumental sums of bars in Aberdeen that are also worthwhile a attempt.","Successful"

0.0,917.0,0.0,0.0001628398895263672,"Having heard a lot about Koi restaurant (located on the second floor of the infamous Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino) from such television shows as \""""Celebrity Hot Spots\"""" on VH1, I was eager to wine and dine at this establishment on a resent jaunt to Las Vegas. Koi possesses a Japanese-inspired, Hollywood energy sort of vibe featuring a variety of savory cooked dishes, traditional sushi and sashimi, as well as creative rolls. The d\u00e9cor located within this establishment is absolutely amazing; a seductive harmony of Asian design elements makes this a great atmosphere for romance. This, however, is where my positive review ends.\n     Upon arrival I was greeted by a charming hostess who promptly escorted my boyfriend and me to our cozy little booth in the back of the restaurant. Glancing over the menu, which featured an average of twenty-something dollar items, we decided to share five or six dishes between us. My first negative remark: an establishment that features such remarkable ambiance and rather pricey menu items should not have paper wrapped wooden chopsticks, I laughed, thinking to myself that Koi had spent so much money on the d\u00e9cor they fell a few dollars short when it came to the utensils. Koi also allows patrons to enter this high end establishment in shorts in flip-flops, which I feel drastically diminishes the appearance of the place. It also became evident after waiting twenty minutes for any kind of service whatsoever, that this establishment was extremely under staffed. The drink menu was that of any standard high end Japanese restaurant so I decided to be a rebel and order an Asahi from their extensive beer menu; they possessed almost all of the Thai/Japanese beers I knew! Unfortunately, the waitress was so busy she ran by our table, dropped my boyfriend and my beer on the table with a chilled glass without a word and scurried off to assist another table. I'm not trying to be a snob, but shouldn't she have at least assisted in pouring my beer for me?! At my local watering hole sushi spot they always pour my beer for me, oh well. After another twenty something minute wait we finally gave our order, let me walk you through the items I chose to indulge!\n\n     Miso Soup, $5: I like the quality of the Miso Soup better at my local sushi spot in San Francisco. I felt like Koi's version was seriously lacking salt, and somewhat bland. \n     Edamame, $6: Awesome! Freshly steamed and hot with just the right amount of salt! I feel like Edamame can get soggy rather quickly but to my pleasant surprise, no soggy factor!\n     Tuna Tartare, $15: This was by far my favorite dish of the evening. In hindsight, I would have ordered five of this dish and called it a day! One order includes two silver dollar sized portions, rather small for how scrumptious this dish was. They serve the tuna with avocado on top of a deliciously crispy wonton, fabulous!\n     Yellow Tail Carpaccio, $20: Not impressed with this dish at all! I love yellow tail/Hamachi, but the quality of this fish was not fresh by any means. Again, I prefer the quality of fish at my local spot (maybe I should write a review for my local spot...) The yellow tail was thinly cut (like any carpaccio should be), dressed in Grapeseed oil, Ponzu, and Wasabi-Tobiko, which seemed rather oily and lacking any wasabi kick which I was craving.\n     Kope Beef Potstickers $23: These had an excellent flavor, although it seemed like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for a while due to the lacking wait staff. Served with a Ponzu dipping sause, I gobbled these down quickly. I'm convinced if these were served immediately after preparation had been completed I would have had absolutely no complaints whatsoever.\n     Baked Crab Roll, $12: Great roll, nice and creamy crab with a pleasant crunch on the exterior. Included wasabi and un-dyed ginger which was refreshing.\n     Veggi Tempura, $18: I loved the selection of vegetables they included in this dish; Asparagus, Green Beans, Yams, Onions, Shitakes, Eggplant and Carrots. Nice and crispy yet not over battered like tempura can be at times. I would have preferred a traditional dipping sauce however, the side sauce Koi paired with the dish was rather greasy, causing me after a few bites to simply shove it aside.\n\n     After completion of our meal, my boyfriend and I mutually decided to dine elsewhere for desert. I was not pleased with the service I received here, nor the quality of food in which was served. I would rather dine at Tao (located within the Venetian) or Nobu (Hard Rock) where I receive fabulous service that actually suits the high priced menu items.

Despite this, I very calmly let the security person know that the only people who had been in our room prior to our money and jewelry missing were the ones registered to the room, and we were the only ones who had key cards.

The security guard then basically told us sorry but that she couldn't do anything for us other than file the report...\n\nI was already upset, but what ended up pissing me off about the whole situation was when security called me on my cell while at I was at a day party to ask if we knew any other guests staying at the hotel -- I let them know we had 2 other rooms booked in our party and I even gave them their room #s, that's when security basically insinuated that it was probably one of our friends from one of the other rooms who had gone in our room and stolen from us!! I could NOT BELIEVE they were trying to tell me this, and I was INFURIATED.  Despite this, I very calmly let the security person know that the only people who had been in our room prior to our money and jewelry missing were the ones registered to the room, and we were the only ones who had key cards.  The security kept asking if I was sure, and I told them to check the cameras and they would see that I wasn't lying.\n\nIt wasn't until after we returned to pool party and we were getting ready for dinner that I also noticed that several bracelets, earrings and necklaces missing from inside of a jewelry bag had stored in my zipped up suitcase. This definitely added more salt to the wound.\n\nSeeing that it is Vegas, I can get over having my money stolen as I probably would have spent it on alcohol or gambled it away anyway.  It's the jewelry I am more upset about since there were items that were personal to me.\n\nIn total, our room had about $1000 worth of CASH AND JEWELRY STOLEN FROM OUR LOCKED HOTEL ROOM !!!!\n\nOverall, I am extremely horrified at the lack of sensitivity displayed by the Palms Place hotel staff and management. No apologies were offered for what happened in our room by any management, and no one even offered to switch us rooms so we would at least feel safer.  The hotel staff was very uncooperative, unprofessional, untrustworthy, uncaring and very insensitive. PLEASE DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!! It is very unsafe -- you may be robbed and if that were to happen, the management will not care about you or anything you will have lost.\n\nFYI, IT'S 3 DAYS LATER AND I STILL HAVE HAD NO FOLLOW UP FROM THE MANAGEMENT AND NO HOTEL STAFF HAS RETURNED MY CALLS OR EMAIL ABOUT THE REPORT WE FILED.","Successful"

This wasn't that bad, but it's not all that special either.  \n\nWhen we saw the Yelp! reviews of this new restaurant we were anxious to check it out.  Lao food is also the food of Issan, as northeastern Thailand is called (where the people are mostly ethnically Lao or Khmer). \n\nAnyway, Lao/Issan food is kind of like the soul food of Thailand - down home, earthy, super spicy and very delicious.  Also very hard to find anywhere in the States outside of L.A. or Vegas.  \n\nWe scanned the menu for a long time searching for the Lao/Issan component but that did not appear to exist.  We asked the waitress - who couldn't speak Thai by the way - where the Lao food was and she said it was \""""all mixed in.\""""  Uhmmm... okie dokie.  Basically, it's all 100% Thai food.  (As was every single other thing in the restaurant). Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we were kind of geared up for some nice spicy Lao food.  That wasn't going to happen.\n\nThe menu is a pretty standard Thai-American menu. Sadly, there wasn't even one of the classic Lao/Issan dishes.  Just the usual stuff.\n\nWe opted for the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and Yam Woon Sen, both traditional Thai dishes.   Both were okay, by American standards, not particularly spicy, even though we had ordered them that way.  Neither dish had fresh chilis.  The Yam Woon Sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodles but it was alright.  The Drunken noodles were okay.  Again, not nearly as spicy as they should be.  \n\nThat little four-jar condiment tray isn't some Lao-Thai innovation, that's a \""""kreung prung,\"""" a standard Thai noodle shop item that's found on every table in Thailand.  It's supposed to supplement the fresh chilis in a dish, not supplant them.  The dishes need to have fresh chilis cooked in them as well, not just crushed dried chilis added on top.\n\nThe real problem is that honest-to-goodness Thai food just isn't acceptable to Americans - too salty, too sour, too fishy, too spicy - so it can only survive in communities like LA or Vegas where there is enough of a Thai population to support it with exclusively Thai patrons.\n\nAnyway, big portions, although a tad expensive with virtually everything on the menu over $10.  If you're hungry and in the neighborhood it's okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip.\n\nIf you really want to have traditional Thai food, your best bet is to get invited to one of the Thai temples on a festival day, when all the older Thai women bring home-cooked food.",1.0,0.6470882296562195,"Not bad.  \n\nWe moved to AZ from Bangkok and my wife is Thai and a superb cook to boot, so we're kind of a tough crowd as far as Thai food goes.

Also very hard to find anywhere in the States outside of L.A. or Vegas.  \n\nWe scanned the menu for a long time searching for the Lao/Issan component but that did not appear to exist.  We asked the waitress - who couldn't speak Thai by the way - where the Lao food was and she said it was \""""all mixed in.\""""  Uhmmm... okie dokie.  Basically, it's all 100% Thai food.  (As was every single other thing in the restaurant). Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we were kind of geared up for some nice spicy Lao food.  That wasn't going to happen.\n\nThe menu is a pretty standard Thai-American menu. Sadly, there wasn't even one of the classic Lao/Issan dishes.  Just the usual stuff.\n\nWe opted for the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and Yam Woon Sen, both traditional Thai dishes.   Both were okay, by American standards, not particularly spicy, even though we had ordered them that way.  Neither dish had fresh chilis.  The Yam Woon Sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodles but it was alright.  The Drunken noodles were okay.  Again, not nearly as spicy as they should be.  \n\nThat little four-jar condiment tray isn't some Lao-Thai innovation, that's a \""""kreung prung,\"""" a standard Thai noodle shop item that's found on every table in Thailand.  It's supposed to supplement the fresh chilis in a dish, not supplant them.  The dishes need to have fresh chilis cooked in them as well, not just crushed dried chilis added on top.\n\nThe real problem is that honest-to-goodness Thai food just isn't acceptable to Americans - too salty, too sour, too fishy, too spicy - so it can only survive in communities like LA or Vegas where there is enough of a Thai population to support it with exclusively Thai patrons.\n\nAnyway, big portions, although a tad expensive with virtually everything on the menu over $10.  If you're hungry and in the neighborhood it's okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip.\n\nIf you really want to have traditional Thai food, your best bet is to get invited to one of the Thai temples on a festival day, when all the older Thai women bring home-cooked food.","Successful"

Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here.  They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself.  The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat.  My husband wanted a Jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither (no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don't offer soda with artificial sweeteners).  However the bartender recommended he try the Tennessee Rum Cider.

I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in the door.  Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here.  They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums awfully are the main concentrates and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to reinforcing and highlight the flavor of the rum itself.  The first one me tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really tasty, though I expected more heat.

Instead we had to call the host to find us a server.  But I would go back here again for some alright, authentic Italian food.

Overbreaded, it was slicing into a rock (and they don't give you a serrated knife, which would be helpful - instead they warn you about possible burns from spurting hot butter).  It was bland, with virtually no flavor whatsoever.  The best part of the meal was the \""""fries\"""" that came with it - julienne strips of potato with dill and an addictive oily sauce.  Hubby tasted his mashed potatoes that came with his Shashlik and that was the only bite he ate of them.. but he kept stealing potatoes from my plate.\n\nWith tip, we paid about $85 for a meal for two that wasn't worth half that.\n\nOverall description.. tacky, boring, bland.","Successful"

Of course, the lake is right there which also adds to the atmosphere. Margaritas were $5 on Mondays, which we were happy about because that was number on our list that day. The menu had lots of great choices but we decided to just order two appetizers.

A manager was walking around checking everything the entire time and was actually the one that asked if we wanted a second drink. I always like it when managers are hands on with customers.\n\nMy only negative is that one item we ordered was more expensive than we thought. The menu we looked at was for the cantina only, not the main restaurant. Apparently, the cantina has its own specials.

So we decided to try one of new neighbors and I have to say that we were very appalled. \n\nThe inside is beautiful with wood beams and little false roofs that make the atmosphere cozy. Of course, the lake is right there which also adds to the atmosphere. Margaritas were $5 on Mondays, which we were happy about because that was number on our list that day. The menu had lots of great choices but we decided to just order two appetizers. We got a mixed mini taco plate and sliders.\n\nBoth of our choices were first rate, not greasy, and were served quickly. We thought the service was exceptional. A manager was walking around checking everything the entire time and was actually the one that asked if we wanted a second drink. I always like it when managers are hands on with customers.\n\nMy only pernicious is that one item we ordered was more expensive than we thought.

Sounds attractive, until you consider that most large items simply do not sell.\n\nI have been going there for years, and the store always looks the same. Most large items remain in the store for long periods of time and do not move anywhere. Which means essentially that you can expect to sell (if you're lucky) about $100 worth of small stuff a month and make exactly no money from it. Which is what I did for two and a half months before saying \""""no more.\""""\n\nThe management staff treated me somewhat apprehensively when I originally inquired about the case, which was off-putting. Maybe because I'm a younger guy in my twenties and most other sellers must be around middle-age or better. But after a while (20 minutes of waiting to be exact) I was finally helped with the paperwork so I could move my products in. \n\nHere's a fun fact: sellers can \""""volunteer\"""" to work in the store in exchange for credit toward their monthly fees. Which amounts to about $7 an hour if you do the math. Despite this, these volunteers were the ONLY people that were genuinely friendly and helpful toward me. They always complimented my case and the artwork of mine that I sold in it.\n\nAnyway, long story short. Nothing significant sold. I was losing money in spades. I sold some small rare items for meager returns that failed to even help me break even after the dues and fees. When I came in to discontinue my membership, the management was less-than empathetic to say the least. I would venture to say they didn't give a damn at all.\n\nMind you, the place has about two dozen glass cases empty at any given time. To retain selling customers, a logical measure would be to perhaps reduce the monthly fee or take some steps to help ensure customer satisfaction in some way. But no, not for the Brass Armadillo, they are above that and would rather have empty cases that net them zero profits, I guess.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience as a seller in the Brass Armadillo has been thoroughly dissatisfying. I would urge anyone considering to sell there to first try Craigslist or eBay because you'll lose a lot less time and money that way and it pains me to say that people on the internet will probably be more friendly toward you.\n\nHere's to a few hundred dollars and a paycheck's worth of my time that I'll never see again.",1.0,0.857418417930603,"Let me first say that the Brass Armadillo is a great place to SHOP.

I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \""""John\"""" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues. He gave me the name of the owner \""""Aaron\"""" and let them know I was not paying for food I didnt eat and I wanted to talk to the owner tomorrow to let him know about my experience. I could show him all the problems with his restaurant starting with his so called \""""manager\"""" who stands around doing shots instead of trying to help the business flow better. This place needs to go on bar rescue. I hope the owner sees this and does something about it. He needs to get some real staff in there with rules and that know a thing or two about customer service.","Successful"

We live only a few blocks away and visited five times over the summer and early fall of 2011.

Any foibles were dismissed as coming with the territory of sitting on the terrase (aka, the sidewalk, but with parasols.) In hindsight, maybe we should have learned...but we were young and foolish.\n\nFirst, though, is the food: The breakfast offerings at Le Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9 are simply to die for. The various eggs benedicts are among the best I've ever had, and they use Bearnaise sauce on a couple of them, the B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and the Florentine, which have made them my go-to favourites. My girlfriend and I have tried the omelets, the crepes and the big, bad Gourmand (their cultured equivalent of a trucker's breakfast) and everything has been of the highest possible quality, even in areas where it's not expected, like the tastiness of the garnishes or the exact perfect amount of sauce.\n\nBut.....\n\nMy friends from France often regale me with stories of poor, snotty, disinterested, apathetic customer service in their home country.

Their chefs are obviously capable and proud of what they send out, but the front-of-house staff couldn't care less about whether your plates get cleared, whether your water or coffee gets topped up, whether you have enough sugar or milk (you usually don't), if you liked your food, or, frankly, whether you live or die. They will NOT come back to see if you need anything, so, like checking your bag before driving away from a McDonald's drive-thru, I suggest grabbing your server by the apron when they bring your meal, and holding on tight while you inspect everything, because that's the last you'll see of them at your table. Fail at that task, and be prepared to head over to the bar for anything you need from that point on. On top of that, they don't know how to prioritize, and will leave you standing at the door for ten minutes when you arrive, even if there are empty tables galore, because they're too frazzled or apathetic to get you seated with your menus before they take care of something else. I'd say they were understaffed if they had any jump in their step while ignoring you.\n\nSo here's the verdict: If you have two hours to kill on a sunny morning, and want to go someplace with a wonderful menu where you can sit outside, drink a nonrefillable beverage, and tip very low (I'd say 4%-6% is warranted if they don't screw up your order) then this may very well be the best place in the Plateau for you! If, however, you value service, like to be attended to more than three times (order, food and bill) and have your simple, quaint needs like \""""Puis-j'avoir une fourchette, s'il vous plait?\"""" addressed respectfully or promptly, your expectations are too high for Le Pass\u00e9 Compos\u00e9.\n\nI know there is no horror story here, because nothing really bad has ever happened, and the bistro is otherwise beautiful, flavourful and wonderfully located.

We decided to dine outside where our smile-less waitress continued to bus the table next to us.  Rather than taking the previous diners full glasses of water back to the kitchen she chose to hurl the water into the street while we were eating.  Now I know this isn't a fancy restaurant but along with the sour puss she wore the whole time we were there I commented this to be snippy.  Both food was decent, but one of the entrees was over cooked.  When we didn't ask to box it she asked if there was something wrong and I told her the beef was really really tough.  She said she would take it off the bill and did, thankfully.  When I went in later to drop off the check she did finally come out with a little personality and say that she tried our dish and it was awful and that she was sorry.  All in all there wasn't anything that would encourage me to come back.","Successful"

I have always been a fan of the food truck but found it too taxing to try to figure out where the truck was parked, what time and if there was any food left. So basically FAME is the food court at linq.

NOT! I gave it 2 stars coz the couple times we went there the place wasn't packed and had plenty of seats available. Also they had utensils and condiments that u could use on each table.

If not for these I would've given it a 1 star. \nOk so 1.)\""""BEARD PAPA\"""" - they are supposedly famous for their cream puffs, I tried the chocolate one with vanilla cream, it was good but no wow factor especially at almost $4 a piece. It wasn't too sweet which is good. I tried their drinks as well, milk tea was good and mango slush was good, the drinks are huge and this is the only size it comes in avg at 10$/ drink. So ya it's going to be a pretty expensive snack! \n2.) FUKU BURGER - my all time faves have always been the tamago burger, the spicy burger, Naga dog and the togarashi fries. Please note that they cook their burgers medium so If u don't like seeing pink in your burgers u can specify how you want the meat cooked. I am sad to say though that although the food was still good the quality of food I had that day was below par. I had asked for my spicy burger to be medium well, it came out well done, also the fries were a bit on the overcooked side. On top of the food coming out about 20 mins. Later they had shorted us an order of the Katsu burger which he had forgotten to dispute since we were so hungry already and the kids were driving us nuts. So that was $10 for nothing. And yes... the burgers and hot dogs avg at around $10 per item and no fries or drink included, they have fountain drinks available at $10/drink coz it's in a so called \""""souvenir cup\"""". So better get ur soda elsewhere. So bottom line... was not impressed anymore and got the craving out of my system. \n3.) \""""No name chinese/thai/Japanese identity crisis - ish \"""" this is the place that has a Chinese character for a name.

Shrimp dumplings - the wrapper was too thick and it had 2 tiny pcs. Of shrimp in it which was falling apart when u bit into it. So when u eat it u have to eat it in one big bite and u get a mouth full of the wonton wrapper. Gyozas- wrapper also very thick and the ground pork filling was falling apart as well. UDON SOUP - soup base was a dark brown color and did not taste good at all... at least the noodles were edible. Ramen - the soup tasted fishy and too salty. BBQ pork platter - this one was the worst, it took them almost 1 hour to serve this and when I tried the BBQ pork I had to SPIT IT OUT! it was just nasty!
